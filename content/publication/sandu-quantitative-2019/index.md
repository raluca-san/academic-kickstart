abstract: "In  image-guided  percutaneous  ablations  of  liver  tumors, the technical intra-procedural success of the treatment  is  defined  by  achieving  complete  tumor  destruction  plus  a  circumferential ablation margin of at least 5 mm.  In the current  setting,  the  ablation  success  is  visually  evaluated  by  an  interventional  radiologist  who  compares  the  differences  between  the  pre-  and  post-ablation  images.  To  address  this  limitation, we have developed an image-based analysis pipeline  to compute radiomics for evaluating the volumetric coverage of  the ablation. In this work, we present preliminary results after  applying  the  radiomics  extraction  pipeline  to  a  retrospective  cohort  of  102  patients  that  were  treated  with  image-guided  percutaneous  microwave  ablations  for  colorectal  liver  metastases."
