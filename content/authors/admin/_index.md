Hi there. I am Raluca. This is my personal website, where you can find my short (professional) bio.
I am at core a computer scientist, having been studying programming and algorithms since I was 14 years old. However, my interest has always been the application of technology in the biomedical field to improve people's well-being.

Consequently,  I have mostly worked  on healthcare/medical related projects, despite having started my academic pursuit with control engineering and applied informatics.

Currently, my research is at the interface of computer-assisted systems and focuses on developing solutions that can improve the diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer - using data mining, statistics, and machine learning.
