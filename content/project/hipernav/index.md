HiPerNav (High Performance Soft Tissue Navigation) is an Innovative Training Network (ITN) funded through a EU Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant. This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 722068. I am one of the 14 funded PhD’s working on the project. My PhD project is carried out in the Image-Guided Therapy group at the ARTORG Center for Biomedical Engineering (University of Bern).

You can find out more information about the project on the website of the project: https://hipernav.eu/
